# Motor At Home

Disclaimer: this project is a work in progress, nothing is actually ready yet, do not download the executable or follow the instructions below.

## What it is
This version of Motor is specifically designed with one goal in mind: find a wild corrupt Pokémon that has 4 legal moves (index between 0 and 470) when corrupting Rotom in the English version of Pokémon Platinum.  
This would open the door for new record breaking possibilities in the any% speedrun category of this game.

## How to participate
- Download `MotorAtHome.exe` from the release page (compiled for Windows), or build the source yourself for your machine
- Download [this file](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/8vwhzn7abvs4rr952xvjh/seedpidiv32.bin?rlkey=awzyao1rlo5esinjajvgb2pcv&dl=0) and put it in the same directory as `MotorAtHome.exe`
- Request an available 32-bit TID (or range of TIDs) [here](https://github.com/RETIREglitch)
- Once you have one, run the program with your TID value, for example `motorathome 1234abcd`
- If you requested a range, run the program with the min and max TID you were given, for example `motorathome 1234abcd 12350000`
- When the search is running, you can see the progression in the console, while the results are being saved to a file (one per TID) in the same directory as the application
- Once the search is complete for a given TID, you can submit your file [here](https://github.com/RETIREglitch)
